\subsection{Preliminaries}
A \textit{Metric Space}~\cite{textbook} is a pair $(M,d)$, where S is a set and $d:M \times M \to \reals$ is a distance metric between all elements in the set. 
To form a metric space, the metric $d$ must obey the properties:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $d(x,y) = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = y$ -identity of indiscernibles
  \item $d(x,y)  = d(y,x)$ - symmetry
  \item $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y, z)$ - triangle inequality
\end{enumerate}

A \textit{grammar} $G = (N,\Sigma,P,S)$ is 
The language of a grammar $\languageOf{G}$ is the set of all words that can be generated by the grammar.

\markk{The work in~\cite{zhu2012randomized} uses a dataflow based model of computation. That model is too restricted for us, but maybe we can use something like that instead of grammars, which are very general?}
