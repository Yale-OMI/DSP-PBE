\section{Overview}

The core of our synthesis algorithm operates on a two layer feedback loop that incrementally refines both the possible structure and the constants of the function.
After each synthesis attempt that fails to produce a solution below the given minimum threshold $\epsilon$, we extra new information about possible future solutions.
The algorithm is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}.
