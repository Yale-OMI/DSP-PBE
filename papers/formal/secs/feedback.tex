\section{Learning from failed attempts}

On key feature of our synthesis is the feedback loop structure that allows us to learn from incorrect program structures.
Each time that the parameter tuning phase fails to produce a program $p(c)$ that meets the cost threshold, we can extract information from that search that allows us to improve our choice of program structure from within the language of the current grammar, $\languageOf{G}$.
