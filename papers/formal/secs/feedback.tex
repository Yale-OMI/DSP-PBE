\section{Learning from failed attempts}
\label{sec:feedback}

On key feature of our synthesis is the feedback loop structure that allows us to learn from incorrect program structures.
Each time that the parameter tuning phase fails to produce a program $p(c)$ that meets the cost threshold, we can extract information from that search that allows us to improve our choice of program structure from within the language of the current grammar, $\languageOf{G}$.

Additionally, we can improve our next parameter search over a new program structure.
To do this, we map the parameters from the best program in the previous parameter search onto the new program structure.
In this way, we can choose a better starting point for our parameter search.
