Previously, the machine learning and semantic modelling approach to program synthesis have been viewed as at odds with one another.
Depending on the context, one or the other outperforms the other~\cite{devlin2017robustfill}.
In this work, we join the two approaches together in a restricted example domain (where the example domain forms a metric space).

The work of~\cite{misailovic2011probabilistically} introduces a notion of approximate correctness of program transformation over probabilistic programs.
Aside from our work focusing on synthesis, we also are working over deterministic programs - our notion of approximate is not with respect to probabilistic outcomes, but closeness in the metric space.
