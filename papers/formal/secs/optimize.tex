\section{Parameter tuning}
\label{sec:opt}

In the parameter tuning phase of the algorithm we can leverage existing optimization techniques to find the best constants $\constants$ for a given program structure $p$.

While gradient descent is an option, APBE is applied when $\distFxn$ is slow, so we should instead consider alternatives to gradient descent.
