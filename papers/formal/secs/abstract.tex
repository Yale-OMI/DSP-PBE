The problem of programming-by-example is to analyze a set of input/output examples and discover a program that generalizes the mapping from input to output.
The problem of supervised learning is to analyze a training set of labelled samples and discover a model that generalizes the mapping from sample point to label.
We explore the relationship between a formalization of these two problems in the context of program synthesis.
We propose a class of program synthesis problems, Approximate Programming-by-Example, 
   that requires both a semantics-driven search, as is common in programming-by-example,
   and a numerical-driven search, as is common in supervised learning.
We propose a methodolgy to solve Approximate Programming-by-Example problem, 
   and present an implemented of this approach in the domain of Digital Signal Processing program synthesis.
