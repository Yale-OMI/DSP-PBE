\section{Structural Synthesis}
\label{sec:struct}
In order to generate a reduced grammar $G', \languageOf{G'} \subset \languageOf{G}$, we require domain-specific knowledge from the user.
Specifically, the user provides our synthesis system with a set of grammar transformations \mbox{$t: \typeOfGrammar \to \typeOfGrammar$}, where the transformations strictly reduce the size of the set terminals that the grammar can generate, \mbox{$\forall G \in \typeOfGrammar. \ \languageOf{t(G)} \subseteq \languageOf{G}$}.
The user then also provides a refinement predicate $r: \exampleDomain \to \exampleDomain \to Boolean$ that describes when each transformation $t$ can be applied. 

The problem of checking language containment ($\languageOf{G_{1}} \subset \languageOf{G_{2}}$) for arbitrary context-free grammars $G_1$ and $G_2$ is undecidable in general~\cite{hopcroft1969equivalence}.
We will limit the transformation to be one that only modifies production rules $\productionRules$.
In this way, the transformation $t: \productionRules \to \productionRules$ 


If the input/output examples have some relation $r$, then we can transform the search space in a way that removes potential programs that are not good.
Put formally:

\begin{align*}
   r(i,o) &\implies \\
   & \forall p \in \languageOf{G} \setminus \languageOf{t(G)}. \\
   & \exists p' \in \languageOf{t(G)}. \\
   & \distFxn(o,p(i)) > \distFxn(o,p'(i)) 
\end{align*}
