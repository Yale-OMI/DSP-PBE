\section{Introduction}

Approximate programming-by-example combines reasoning-based program search with numerical search methods from machine learning.
The high-level idea is to shrink the search space as much as possible with formal methods, then switch over to machine learning.

\markk{when do we want approximate solutions? how do we formalize when it is ok}

This paper makes the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We present a comparison between programming-by-example and supervised learning using a common notation in order to understand the difference between the two problems.
\item We define the Approximate Programming-by-example class of problems, which lies at the intersection of these two problem domains.
\item We propose a counter-example guided synthesis algorithm for Approximate Programming-by-example and present an implementation and evaluation of this in the domain of Digital Signal Processing program synthesis 
\end{enumerate}
