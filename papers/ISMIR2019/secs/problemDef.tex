\section{Problem Statement}

One of the core challenges in applying programming by example for DSP is to quantify how close our synthesized solution is to the correct solution.
In this case, the closeness of two audio files is a subjective measure - we do not necessarily know what features of the input/output audio pair the user is trying to emulate.
We use as the distance function, $\distFxn$, between two audio files, an audio fingerprinting technique~\cite{SantolucitoFARM} that approximates a measure of how different two audio clips sound to the human ear.
This metric is focused on measuring the amplitudes of frequency peaks obtains from a sliding window FFT.

\begin{align*}
\sum_{t=0}^{ts}\ \sum_{i=0}^{p} euclid\Big(\ &peak(i,toC(x)@t), \\ &peak(i,toC(y)@t)\ \Big)
\end{align*}

While measuring frequency peaks require temporally aligned audio, this can be achieved with advances in dynamic time warping techniques for audio~\cite{carabias2015audio}.
To contain the scope of the DSP-PBE problem, we assume that the user has provided audio that is temporally aligned.
As a technical note, this also requires that the sample rates of the audio match, which again we assume the user handles for simplicity.

A \textit{metric space}~\cite{textbook} is a set with a structure that allows us to measure this sense of approximate.
A metric space is defined as a pair $(M,d)$, where S is a set and $d:M \times M \to \reals$ is a distance metric between all elements in the set. 
To form a metric space, the metric $d$ must obey the properties:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $d(x,y) = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = y$ - identity of indiscernibles
  \item $d(x,y)  = d(y,x)$ - symmetry
  \item $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y, z)$ - triangle inequality
\end{enumerate}



This is not actually a metirc space. Here is an example of two audio files that violate the identity of indiscernibles property of a metric space.
However, this is a pathological examples and in most cases is close enough for us. 
We show that this is a metric space by running a set of tests of real world audio files
