\section{Evaluation}

To evaluate our approach, we apply our synthesis algorithm to the domain of digital signal processing.

\textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} & \textbf{dist(o, $f$(i))} & \textbf{Structural Attempts} & \textbf{Time (sec)}

\markk{just need to implement the refinement type pruning for DSP-PBE and that should be good - will also have a nice comparison between the times for that approach and this new one. Need to be really clear that the running times are not really to be compared to other synthesis procedures, since this is solving a different problem. We will have the FARM paper to compare, but that is a fixed program structure, so much less expressive. We should still be fast tho}.
