\section{Evaluation}

To evaluate our approach, we apply our synthesis algorithm to two sets of input/output examples.
The first set captures the use case of \ourTool where a user wants to model real world sounds.
This set consists of trumpet sounds with various mutes.
The second set of example input/output we run \ourTool on focuses on more creative applications.
Here we attempt to transform whitenoise into various clips from Brian Eno's Music for Airports.

The results of running \ourTool on the trumpet mute sounds benchmarks are reported in Table~\ref{table:eval}.

\begin{table*}[]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|c|}

\textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} & \textbf{dist(o, $f$(i))} & \textbf{Structural Attempts} & \textbf{Time (sec)}

\markk{just need to implement the refinement type pruning for DSP-PBE and that should be good - will also have a nice comparison between the times for that approach and this new one. Need to be really clear that the running times are not really to be compared to other synthesis procedures, since this is solving a different problem. We will have the FARM paper to compare, but that is a fixed program structure, so much less expressive. We should still be fast tho}.
