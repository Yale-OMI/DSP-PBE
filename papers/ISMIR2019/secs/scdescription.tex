\section{SC3 Program Generation}

In order to make our \ourTool more accessible to those producing music, 
we present means to translate the produced filter into working SC3 code.
We convert each of the DSPNodes into corresponding SC3 UGens.
To make the generated SC3 code more human-readable variables are used to pass intermediate signals around.

\sam{should we have figures of an example generated supercollider program here ?}
