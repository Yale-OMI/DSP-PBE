DSP programming requires users to have experience with both programming fundamentals and an understanding of digital audio.
To assist novice DSP programmers in writing code, we introduce a tool for automatically generating SuperCollider programs from examples of audio input and output.
A user provides two audio files, and the system generates a SuperCollider program that transforms the input to the output.
Our system supports a range of filter types, including noncommutative filters.
We present the results of running our tool on a set of benchmark audio example pairs.
