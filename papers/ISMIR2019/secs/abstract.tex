Digital Sginal Processing (DSP) programming requires users to have experience with both programming fundamentals and an understanding of digital audio.
To assist novice DSP programmers in writing code, we introduce a tool for automatically generating SuperCollider programs from examples of audio input and output.
A user provides an example of an audio transformation in the form of an two audio files, an input and an output file.
The system takes these two audio files and generates a SuperCollider program that transforms the input to the output.
In order to support synthesis of DSP programs on complex filters such as noncommutative filters, we introduce a new synthesis algorithm that searches for a structural form of a filter and the parameter values for the filter in two seperate stages.
We present the results of running our tool on a set of benchmark audio example pairs.
