DSP programming requires users to have experience with both programming fundamentals and an understanding of digital audio.
To assist novice DSP programmers in writing code, we introduce a tool for automatically generating SuperCollider programs from examples of audio input and output.
A user provides two audio files, and the system generates a SuperCollider program that transforms the input to the output.
While commutative filter can be found by measuring the room impluse response, noncommutative filters do not behave in such predictable ways.
In order to support noncommutative filters, we introduce a new synthesis algorithm that searches for a structural form of a fitler and the parameter values for the filter in two seperate stages.
We present the results of running our tool on a set of benchmark audio example pairs.
