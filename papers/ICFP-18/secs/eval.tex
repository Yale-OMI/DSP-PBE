\section{Evaluation}

We implemented a DSP-PBE tool based on the approach described in Section~\ref{sec:distance} and Section~\ref{sec:search}.

Our tool is written in Haskell and uses the Vivid library~\cite{vivid} for bindings to SuperCollider~\cite{supercollider}.
Haskell allows easy access to type information and metaprogram construction tools that are useful for program synthesis, however the programs themselves are easily translated back to SuperCollider ``synth defs'', which are DSP filter programs.

Some example filters we can reconstruct and running times.
