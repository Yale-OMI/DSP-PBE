\section{Evaluation}

We implemented a tool, \ourTool, that implements our approach to DSP-PBE.

Our tool is written in Haskell and uses the Vivid library~\cite{vivid} for bindings to SuperCollider~\cite{SC}.
Haskell allows easy access to type information and metaprogram construction tools that are useful for program synthesis, however the programs themselves are easily translated back to SuperCollider 'synth defs'.

Some example filters we can reconstruct and running times.
