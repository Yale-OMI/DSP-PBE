\section{Evaluation}

We implemented a DSP-PBE tool based on the approach described in Section~\ref{sec:distance} and Section~\ref{sec:search}.

Our tool is written in Haskell and uses the Vivid library~\cite{vivid} for bindings to SuperCollider~\cite{supercollider}.
Haskell allows easy access to type information and metaprogram construction tools that are useful for program synthesis, however the programs themselves are easily translated back to SuperCollider ``synth defs'', which are DSP filter programs.

Some example filters we can reconstruct and running times.

\begin{tabular}{|c | c | c|} 
 \hline
 Description & True Filter & Synthesized Filter & Time (sec) \\ 
 \hline\hline
 Cartoon Spring & lpf(800)  & & \\
 Cartoon Spring & lpf(5000) & & \\
 BTS DNA (Kpop) & lpf(2000) & & \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
