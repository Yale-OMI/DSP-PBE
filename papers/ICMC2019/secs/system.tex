\section{System Overview}

How much of this should be the algorithm and how much should be implementation specific

\subsection{Aural Distance as a Metric Space}

In FARM we did not explain details about properties of the aural distance.
These properties make this a metric space, which is good for machine learning.

\subsection{Gradient Descent}

We use a modified version of gradient descent to find good parameters for the filter.
Have to decide how much to go into this - probably too technical for ICMC, but there are few things that are new from FARM that would be nice to highlight

\subsection{Choosing an initial starting point}

As a very rough estimate, if the max freq peak of the output is less than the max freq peak of input
  we need a lpf, and it should have a value a bit less than the max peak of output

\subsection{Searching for DSP structure}

Just brute force for now - maybe guided by user? 
Something smarter can come later.

\subsection{Generating Program Code}
