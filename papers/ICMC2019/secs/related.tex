Various resynthesis techniques - a lot of these are covered in the FARM paper.
\markk{Particularly interested in getting Scott's input on this one.}

Programming-by-example is a research field that has had an explosion of growth in the past decade. 
A critical point was the introduction of FlashFill in Microsoft Excel 2013~\cite{GulwaniHS12}, a programming-by-example technology that allows users to automatically generate excel scripts to transform data.
The majority of

In prior work has explored the application of programming-by-example to digital signal processing~\cite{SantolucitoFARM}.
This work was focused on reconstructing DSP filters from digital examples, for example finding the threshold of an applied low-pass filter.
In contrast, this work looks at how programming-by-example can be applied to audio recordings of real-world effects.
One main challenges we face here is that when learning DSP programs to model analog effects, we do not apriori have any information about the correct DSP program.
We must now synthesize, not just the value (e.g. threshold for low-pass), but also the overall structure of the DSP filter.
