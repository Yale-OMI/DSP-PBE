\section{Introduction}

One of the great advances from the availability of audio programming languages, is the ability to model real-world effects as programs.
This allows users to model an analog effect and apply that effect in ways that would not otherwise be possible, for example, using a trumpet mute on a human voice.
However, physical modelling requires a technical depth in DSP that makes it a prohibitively difficult and intimidating task for many novice users.
To address this issue, we apply Digital Signal Processing Programming By Example,
