\section{Future Work and Conclusions}

The main contribution of this paper is to pose the problem of DSP-PBE.
While we have presented a prototype implementation of a DSP-PBE tool, this primarily functions as a proof-of-concept.
There remains significant room for optimization in both the distance calculation and the search algorithm.
