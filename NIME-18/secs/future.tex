\section{Future Work and Conclusions}

The main contribution of this paper is to pose the problem of DSP-PBE.
While we have presented a prototype implementation of a DSP-PBE tool, this primarily functions as a proof-of-concept.
There remains significant room for optimization in both the distance calculation and the search algorithm.

Although with the current tool, synthesis times presented might be prohibitively slow for many use cases, we should be encouraged by progress in other domains of program synthesis.
In the SyGuS program synthesis competition, which has run for 4 years, tools have seen an exponential speed up and increase in the range of programs that can be synthesized.
As one example, in the 2014 competition the \texttt{LinExpr\_eq1.sl} benchmark was only solved by one tool, and took 1128 seconds in 2014~\cite{sygus2014}.
In the 2017 competition, the same benchmark was solved by all tools, with the fastest taking only 199 seconds~\cite{sygus2017}.
