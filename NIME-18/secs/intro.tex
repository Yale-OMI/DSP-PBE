\section{Introduction}

We introduce the problem of DSP programming by example.

\subsection{Gradient Descent}

One trouble with this approach is that we have lots of local minimums in the space of optimization.
Take the example of trying to learn a low-pass filter threshold.
If our initial threshold is too low (cutting off too much), and just on the other side of the threshold is a frequency we need, SGD will easily send us in that direction.
However, if the spectrogram of waveform has a spectrum that is inactive, SGD will detect a pleteau and tell us we have found a global minimum, when in fact we are stuck in a local minimum.
We may be able to use some randomized restarting to hop over these.
